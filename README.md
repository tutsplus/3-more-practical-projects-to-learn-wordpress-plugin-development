## Instructor: [Rachel McCollin][instructor url]


One of the great things about WordPress is how easy it is to add new functionality with plugins. In most cases, the functionality you need already exists in a plugin on WordPress.com or Envato Market. But sometimes, there's just no subsitute for coding a custom plugin that solves a specific problem for your site. 

In this course, you'll create three practical projects to help you learn WordPress plugin development. Learn how to create a list of pages in the current section of your site, to customize the admin pages and to add an attractive display of the most recent post in each category to your home page or below each post in your site.
